##  Our TÜBİTAK project below has been accepted.

Project Name: Implementing Media Based Modulation on SDR.

_Goal: Within the scope of this project, it is aimed to design and implement the printed circuit board (PCB) of the mirrors that perform the MBM technique with the Kicad software. In addition, it is aimed to perform performance simulations of the MBM card to be designed using Matlab and Gnuradio software together. The produced MBM card is capable of wireless broadcasting in the range of 325 MHz - 3.8 GHz and it is aimed to perform real-time testing with a software-based radio (Software Defined Radio, SDR) card called Adalm PLUTO._
