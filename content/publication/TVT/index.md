abstract: " In this correspondence paper, a novel code-index modulation (CIM) aided quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) scheme, called CIM-QSM, is proposed for highly spectrum and energy efficient multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The CIM-QSM scheme transmits information over three different transmit entities: modulated symbols, activated antenna indices, and spreading code indices. Hence, a higher efficiency in terms spectrum and energy use, and better error performance compared to the conventional direct sequence spread spectrum, spatial modulation (SM), QSM, and CIM aided SS (CIM-SS) schemes are obtained by the CIM-QSM technique for MIMO communication systems. Analytical expressions for the average bit error rate, energy efficiency, and throughput of the CIM-QSM system are performed and the theoretical results are validated with Monte Carlo simulation results."
